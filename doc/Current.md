# Current

## Phases
Implement phasing duh. 

## Testing
Need to finish off testing, I think this should wait til phases are set up, as the implementation will probably change signatures.

## Music
Can we music?
Can I have different music for each level? 
Can I have music playing and fx playing over the top?

## Timing
Need to update the way the main loop is called to make it independent of frame rate, and work with the browser better.
